# Free Basic Single Page Bootstrap 4 Theme

This is a very basic Bootstrap template. The source code is very minimal and there is no js in play currently. This template was made to serve as a baseline for elaborating on when designing your theme or website. This is also a great learning tool for those who would like to learn Bootstrap framework and Sass basics.  

For more info on Bootstrap Framework visit the [Bootstrap Website](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/) (NOTE: This template was built using BS4 Alpha 6, Bootstraps current documentation may have been updated beyond this version. Make sure you look at the version you are researching)
